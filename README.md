# Employee Management

The system stores information about the employee. I develop it with ASP .Net Core, and I connect it with the server by using Entity Framework Core. Also, I create and update database with EF Core Code First approach using migrations. The application include the register and login-in page, homepage, interaction page, etc. The business logic was implemented to extract the correct data and presented in the client side. Also this website contains the webpages, decorated by the BOOTSTRAP.

<li>The home page displays the dashboard of the employees list.</li>
<li>The page will redirect to the page that displays all the tasks that are related to the Employee when cliking the employee name</li>
